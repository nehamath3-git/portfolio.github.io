    <h2>Intelligent Agriculture System using Artificial Intelligence Technique</h2><br><br>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence provides farmer with the forecasting and predictive analysis to reduce and minimize 
        the risk of crop failures.This automated agriculture smart farming system was developed to optimise water
        use for growth of agriculture crops through the internet over IoT.<br>
        * The whole economy is based on agriculture.Agriculture field involves the effective production of food,feed,
        fiber and other goods for humans and animals.<br>
        * Using the available technologies in the farming system reduces the efforts of farmers and also to reduce
        time,energy and reduces cost.

    <h2> Use of Artificial Neural Networks for Fake User Detection</h2><br><br>
    <p>
        Usually, we deal with Machine Learning , namely as Artificial Neural Networks to determine what are
        the chances that facebook friend request is authentic or not. We also outline the classes and libraries
        involved. Furthermore,we discuss the sigmoid function and how the weights are determined and used.Finally ,
        we consider the parameters of the social network page which are utmost important in the provided solution.
